# presentation
Explain how you made this tool

explain what it is, use cases, why I made it
explain how you could chain together regexes, but also use a regex wordlist because a long chain of patterns is tedious and ugly


should take a sample of 3 representative wordlists (explain where you got these from)
- 6-digits-000000-999999.txt
- DirBuster-2007_directory-list-lowercase-2.3-big.txt
- milw0rm-dictionary.txt
should take a sample of 3 singular regex patterns, chained regex pattern, 1 wordlist of regexes
should demo all 3 modes of transformation (include, exclude, cut)
